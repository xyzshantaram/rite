            Note that Windows users will need to have
            [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
            installed.

            For Linux, only a .deb build is currently available -- the [Tauri AppImage is
            currently broken](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/2805),
            so you'll have to build from source if you're not on a Debian-based distro."
